These terms included affirming the statement that we “do not, and will not during the term of this financial assistance award, operate any programs that advance or promote DEI, or discriminatory equity ideology in violation of Federal anti-discrimination laws.” This restriction would apply not only to the security work directly funded by the grant, **but to any and all activity of the PSF as a whole**.

These novel tools would rely on capability analysis, designed based on a dataset of known malware.

We&lt;br/&gt;\\nare incredibly grateful for any help you can offer. If you&amp;#39;re already a&lt;br/&gt;\\nPSF member or regular donor, you have our deep appreciation, and we urge&lt;br/&gt;\\n you to share your story about why you support the PSF. Your stories&lt;br/&gt;\\nmake all the difference in spreading awareness about the mission and&lt;br/&gt;\\nwork of the PSF.\\xa0  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html\"&gt;https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It improves performance by -3-30% (I actually removed outliers, otherwise it's 45%), and a geometric mean of ~~9-15%~~(EDIT: 3-5%, see correction notice below) faster on pyperformance depending on platform and architecture.\\xa0**The main caveat however is that it only works with the newest compilers (Clang 19 and newer).**\\xa0We made this opt-in, so there's no backward compatibility concerns. Once the compilers start catching up a few years down the road, I expect this feature to become widespread.\\n\\nPython 3.14 documentation: [https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call](https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call)\\n\\nI have a lot of people to thank for their ideas and help: Mark Shannon, Donghee Na, Diego Russo, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman. Also my academic supervisors Stefan Marr and Manuel Rigger :).\\n\\n(Sorry can't cross-post here) Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1ikqi0d/a\\\\_new\\\\_type\\\\_of\\\\_interpreter\\\\_has\\\\_been\\\\_added\\\\_to/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1ikqi0d/a_new_type_of_interpreter_has_been_added_to/)\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nThe performance numbers given were wrong due to a compiler bug in LLVM 19. I've since revised downwards the numbers to account for the bug. I sincerely apologize to anyone I have unintentionally misled. I was not aware of the compiler bug myself.

It improves performance by -3-30% (I actually removed outliers, otherwise it&amp;#39;s 45%), and a geometric mean of &lt;del&gt;9-15%&lt;/del&gt;(EDIT: 3-5%, see correction notice below) faster on pyperformance depending on platform and architecture.\\xa0&lt;strong&gt;The main caveat however is that it only works with the newest compilers (Clang 19 and newer).&lt;/strong&gt;\\xa0We made this opt-in, so there&amp;#39;s no backward compatibility concerns. Once the compilers start catching up a few years down the road, I expect this feature to become widespread.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Python 3.14 documentation: &lt;a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call\"&gt;https://docs.python.org/3.14/whatsnew/3.14.html#whatsnew314-tail-call&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I have a lot of people to thank for their ideas and help: Mark Shannon, Donghee Na, Diego Russo, Garrett Gu, Haoran Xu, and Josh Haberman. Also my academic supervisors Stefan Marr and Manuel Rigger :).&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Sorry can&amp;#39;t cross-post here) Original post: &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1ikqi0d/a_new_type_of_interpreter_has_been_added_to/\"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammingLanguages/comments/1ikqi0d/a_new_type_of_interpreter_has_been_added_to/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;EDIT:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The performance numbers given were wrong due to a compiler bug in LLVM 19. I&amp;#39;ve since revised downwards the numbers to account for the bug. I sincerely apologize to anyone I have unintentionally misled. I was not aware of the compiler bug myself. See the original release notes for an updated explanation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

We’re about 800 PRs deep!\\n\\n\\n&gt; Like Ruff and uv, there will be a significant focus on performance.\\n&gt; The entire system is designed to be highly incremental so that it can eventually power a language server (e.g., only re-analyze affected files on code change).\\n\\n\\n&gt; Performance is just one of many goals, though.\\n&gt; For example: we're investing heavily in strong theoretical foundations and a consistent model of Python's typing semantics.\\n&gt; (We're lucky to have @carljm and @AlexWaygood on the team for many reasons, this is one of them.)\\n\\n\\n&gt; Another goal: minimizing false positives, especially on untyped code, to make it easier for projects to adopt a type checker and expand coverage gradually over time, without being swamped in bogus type errors from the start.\\n\\n\\n&gt; Warning: this project is _not_ ready for real-world user testing, and certainly not for production use (yet). The core architecture is there, but we're still lacking support for some critical features.\\n&gt; Right now, I'd only recommend trying it out if you're looking to contribute.\\n\\n\\n&gt; For now, we're working towards an initial alpha release.

       "     'selftext': \"Been noticing an interesting trend lately - Rust is becoming the secret sauce behind many of Python's most innovative tools. As someone who works with Python daily, it's fascinating to see how the ecosystem is evolving.\\n\\nHere's what's caught my attention:\\n\\n* **Ruff**: This linter is absurdly fast compared to traditional Python linters. Why? It's written in Rust. We're talking 10-100x speedups here.\\n* **PyOxidizer**: A solid solution for creating standalone Python applications. Again, Rust. (unfortunately not maintained anymore)\\n* **Polars**: This DataFrame library is giving Pandas a run for its money in terms of performance. Guess what? Rust under the hood.\\n* **Maturin**: Making it dead simple to create Python extensions in Rust.\\n\\nMy team has written a blog post diving deeper into this trend, specifically looking at PyO3 (the framework that makes Python/Rust integration possible) and showing how to build your own high-performance Python extensions with Rust. If you wish, you can read it here: [https://www.blueshoe.io/blog/python-rust-pyo3/](https://www.blueshoe.io/blog/python-rust-pyo3/)\\n\\nThe really interesting part is that most Python developers don't even realize they're using Rust-powered tools. It's like Rust is becoming Python's performance co-pilot without much fanfare.\\n\\nWhat are your thoughts on this trend? Have you tried building any Python extensions with Rust?\\n\\n*Full disclosure: Our team at Blueshoe wrote the blog post, but I genuinely think this is an important trend worth discussing.*\",\n",

As someone who works with Python daily, it&amp;#39;s fascinating to see how the ecosystem is evolving.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s caught my attention:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ruff&lt;/strong&gt;: This linter is absurdly fast compared to traditional Python linters. Why? It&amp;#39;s written in Rust. We&amp;#39;re talking 10-100x speedups here.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyOxidizer&lt;/strong&gt;: A solid solution for creating standalone Python applications. Again, Rust. (unfortunately not maintained anymore)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polars&lt;/strong&gt;: This DataFrame library is giving Pandas a run for its money in terms of performance. Guess what? Rust under the hood.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maturin&lt;/strong&gt;: Making it dead simple to create Python extensions in Rust.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My team has written a blog post diving deeper into this trend, specifically looking at PyO3 (the framework that makes Python/Rust integration possible) and showing how to build your own high-performance Python extensions with Rust. If you wish, you can read it here: &lt;a href=\"https://www.blueshoe.io/blog/python-rust-pyo3/\"&gt;https://www.blueshoe.io/blog/python-rust-pyo3/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The really interesting part is that most Python developers don&amp;#39;t even realize they&amp;#39;re using Rust-powered tools. It&amp;#39;s like Rust is becoming Python&amp;#39;s performance co-pilot without much fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What are your thoughts on this trend? Have you tried building any Python extensions with Rust?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: Our team at Blueshoe wrote the blog post, but I genuinely think this is an important trend worth discussing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

He took the idea to senior management and presented the cost saving and benefits. Once it was deployed he was offered shares in the company and then a cash bonus once a year of realised savings was achieved. \\n\\nI’ve been advised by my HR friend to approach senior management with my proposal, explain that I’ve already spoken to my manager and detail the cost savings I can make, ask for a salary increase to provide ongoing support and develop my code further and ask for similar terms to that of the person who did this previously. He has confirmed what I’ve done doesn’t go against any HR policies or my contract. \\n\\nMeeting is booked for next week and I’ve had 2 messages from senior management saying how excited they are to see my idea :) \\n\\n',\n",

He took the idea to senior management and presented the cost saving and benefits. Once it was deployed he was offered shares in the company and then a cash bonus once a year of realised savings was achieved. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I’ve been advised by my HR friend to approach senior management with my proposal, explain that I’ve already spoken to my manager and detail the cost savings I can make, ask for a salary increase to provide ongoing support and develop my code further and ask for similar terms to that of the person who did this previously. He has confirmed what I’ve done doesn’t go against any HR policies or my contract. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Meeting is booked for next week and I’ve had 2 messages from senior management saying how excited they are to see my idea :) &lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'I recenctly started working in a new company. I got a ticket to add some feature to our team\\'s main codebase. A codebase which is essential for our work. It included adding some optional binary flag to one of our base agent classes.\\n\\nDid this, added the option to our agent creator and now is the time to check if my changes work.\\n\\nRun it with the default value - works perfectly. Now change the default value - doesn\\'t work.\\n\\nSo i started wondering, i see the argument flag (we run them using -- flags) being passed, yet the code i\\'m expecting to run isn\\'t running.\\n\\nI put a breakpoint In my new code - The flag is `True` while is was supposed to be `False`. WTF.\\n\\nI continue debugging, adding a breakpoint to the `__init__` and then i saw the argument is `True`. I\\'m certain that i\\'ve passed the correct argument.\\n\\nI continue debugging, couldn\\'t find the bug at first glance.\\n\\nWe have alot of inheritence, like 6 classes worth of inheritence. Think of:\\n\\nBase \\n\\n| \\n\\nmid1 \\n\\n| \\n\\nmid2 \\n\\n| \\n\\nmid3 \\n\\n ...\\n\\n final\\n\\nSo i sat there debugging for a solid hour or two, printing the kwargs, everything looking good untill i tried:\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt; kwargs\\\\[new\\\\_arg\\\\]\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt; KeyError\\n\\nwtf?\\n\\nso i looked at the kwargs more closely and noticed the horror:\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt;print(kwargs)\\n\\n\\\\&gt;&gt;&gt; {\\'kwargs\\': {\\'arg1\\': val, \\'arg2\\': val ....}\\n\\nAnd there it sat, hidden in the \"middle classes (mid1-3)\" This gem of a code\\n\\n    class SomeClass(Base):^M\\n        def __init__(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...,**kwargs):\\n            super().__init__(\\n                arg1=arg1,\\n                arg2=arg2,\\n                arg3=arg3,\\n                arg4=arg4,\\n                arg5=arg5,\\n                kwargs=kwargs\\n                )\\n            # some code\\n\\nNow usually noone really looks at super() when debugging. But for some reason, a previous team lead did `kwargs=kwargs` and people just accepted it, so you have the \"top classes\" passing kwargs properly, but everyone in between just kwargs=kwargs. Now i didn\\'t notice it, and since the code is littered with classes that take 8+ arguments, it was hard to notice at a glace by printing kwargs.\\n\\nJuniors just saw how the classes were made and copied it wihout thinking twice. Now half the classes had this very basic mistake. Safe to say i found it quite funny that a codebase which existed for 5+ years had this mistake from the 4th year.\\n\\nAnd more importantly, noone even noticed that the behaviours that are supposed to change simply didn\\'t change. FOR 4 YEARS the code didn\\'t behave as expected.\\n\\nAfter fixing the code \\\\~5% of our tests failed, apparently people wrote tests about how the code works and not how the code should work.\\n\\nWhat is there to learn from this story? Not much i suppose For juniors, don\\'t blindly copy code without knowing how it works. For people doing crs, check super() and context please maybe?',\n",

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I recenctly started working in a new company. I got a ticket to add some feature to our team&amp;#39;s main codebase. A codebase which is essential for our work. It included adding some optional binary flag to one of our base agent classes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Did this, added the option to our agent creator and now is the time to check if my changes work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Run it with the default value - works perfectly. Now change the default value - doesn&amp;#39;t work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So i started wondering, i see the argument flag (we run them using -- flags) being passed, yet the code i&amp;#39;m expecting to run isn&amp;#39;t running.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I put a breakpoint In my new code - The flag is &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; while is was supposed to be &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;. WTF.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continue debugging, adding a breakpoint to the &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; and then i saw the argument is &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;. I&amp;#39;m certain that i&amp;#39;ve passed the correct argument.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continue debugging, couldn&amp;#39;t find the bug at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We have alot of inheritence, like 6 classes worth of inheritence. Think of:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Base &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;mid1 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;mid2 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;\\n&lt;tr&gt;\\n&lt;/tr&gt;\\n&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;\\n&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;mid3 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;final&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So i sat there debugging for a solid hour or two, printing the kwargs, everything looking good untill i tried:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; kwargs[new_arg]&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; KeyError&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;wtf?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;so i looked at the kwargs more closely and noticed the horror:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;print(kwargs)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {&amp;#39;kwargs&amp;#39;: {&amp;#39;arg1&amp;#39;: val, &amp;#39;arg2&amp;#39;: val ....}&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And there it sat, hidden in the &amp;quot;middle classes (mid1-3)&amp;quot; This gem of a code&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;class SomeClass(Base):^M\\n    def __init__(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...,**kwargs):\\n        super().__init__(\\n            arg1=arg1,\\n            arg2=arg2,\\n            arg3=arg3,\\n            arg4=arg4,\\n            arg5=arg5,\\n            kwargs=kwargs\\n            )\\n        # some code\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Now usually noone really looks at super() when debugging. But for some reason, a previous team lead did &lt;code&gt;kwargs=kwargs&lt;/code&gt; and people just accepted it, so you have the &amp;quot;top classes&amp;quot; passing kwargs properly, but everyone in between just kwargs=kwargs. Now i didn&amp;#39;t notice it, and since the code is littered with classes that take 8+ arguments, it was hard to notice at a glace by printing kwargs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Juniors just saw how the classes were made and copied it wihout thinking twice. Now half the classes had this very basic mistake. Safe to say i found it quite funny that a codebase which existed for 5+ years had this mistake from the 4th year.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And more importantly, noone even noticed that the behaviours that are supposed to change simply didn&amp;#39;t change. FOR 4 YEARS the code didn&amp;#39;t behave as expected.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After fixing the code ~5% of our tests failed, apparently people wrote tests about how the code works and not how the code should work.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;What is there to learn from this story? Not much i suppose For juniors, don&amp;#39;t blindly copy code without knowing how it works. For people doing crs, check super() and context please maybe?&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

But modern video codecs have spent decades optimizing for compression. So I tried converting text into QR codes, then encoding those as video frames, letting H.264/H.265 handle the compression magic.\\n\\nThe results surprised me. 10,000 PDFs compressed down to a 1.4GB video file. Search latency came in around 900ms compared to Pinecone’s 820ms, so about 10% slower. But RAM usage dropped from 8GB+ to just 200MB, and it works completely offline with no API keys or monthly bills.\\n\\nThe technical approach is simple: each document chunk gets encoded into QR codes which become video frames.

I didn\\'t want to do it, but I just can\\'t stand it anymore.\\n\\n**Things I love about PyCharm and will miss**\\n\\n1. The refactoring functionality. VSCode\\'s Python extension has that too, but it isn\\'t as nice. \\n\\nAt this point, that\\'s pretty much it.\\n\\n**Things that drove me nuts**\\n\\n1. IdeaVim. It actually got better recently, but for years and years, the undo function was busted, so you had to hit `u` over and over to undo what in real vim is a single operation. VSCode\\'s neovim plugin uses actual neovim under the hood, which is obviously so much more robust and faithful, while IdeaVim will never be a full implementation.\\n2. The gradual accumulation of simple bugs that never get fixed.\\n3. It\\'s so slow. I didn\\'t appreciate just how slow until I switched over to VSCode. I mean, holy crap, it\\'s 10x faster for a lot of things (opening a project, installing or restarting extensions, for example).\\n\\nHere are the bugs that have bugged me the worst:\\n\\nThe \"usages\" window (cmd-click on a definition, see where it\\'s used) constantly resizes itself too small. It\\'s been a problem for years. They won\\'t fix the way autosize works, OR let us turn it off. Plus you have to get your mouse cursor nearly pixel-perfect to resize it yourself, so you can see the whole code preview. Then the very next time you use it, it\\'s back to its stupidly narrow size.\\n\\n**Type inference is busted.** \\n\\nIf you do something as standard as this, you get a type error on `f`, saying \"Expected type \\'SupportsWrite[bytes]\\', got \\'BufferedWriter\\' instead\":\\n\\n    with open(filename, \"wb\") as f:\\n        pickle.dump(obj, f)\\n\\nAnd I can\\'t just disable the \"unexpected type\" code inspection--it\\'s probably the single most valuable one. So I\\'m stuck with a lot of my files showing warnings that shouldn\\'t be there. Which also keeps me from using the keyboard shortcut to bounce to any real problem of a lower severity.\\n\\nIf you\\'re doing a comprehension inside a class method, and you name the iteration variable the same as a class attribute (e.g., you have `myclass.name`, and you do a comprehension like `[ ... for name in names]`, then the inferred type of the iteration variable overwrites the inferred type of the class attribute. This makes no sense--`name` and `self.name` have nothing to do with one another. This one is easy enough to work around by appending an underscore to the iteration variable\\'s name, but it indicates something is very wrong under the hood.\\n\\nThere are several more specific type inference problems in my codebase, where my method clearly returns `MyType`, but PyCharm infers it as `MyType | None` and throws a warning. The method cannot possibly return `None`, and `mypy` agrees with me. So I\\'m stuck with another spurious warning.\\n\\nThese problems just never, ever get fixed, and they keep on accruing. Add it to the fact that JetBrains IDE\\'s are always second in line for addon support, and I just couldn\\'t justify sticking with it.\\n\\nThanks for coming to my talk, sorry I went over time.\\n\\n**Edit:** I thought of something else I like better about PyCharm: the diff view. It\\'s a lot nicer than VSCode\\'s, which looks more like the actual output of `diff`.',\n",

Its also still one link at a time, so all the great ideas I've received for the website will come soon (I'm gonna keep working on it). It'll take about 1-3 days but ill make it a lot better for the V1.0.0 release.\\n\\nCLI still available on GitHub for those who prefer it.\\n\\n\\n\\nHi everyone,  \\nI made a Python package called **caniscrape** that analyzes any website's anti-bot protections before you start scraping.\\n\\nIt tells you what you're up against (Cloudflare, rate limits, JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, TLS fingerprinting, honeypots) and gives you a difficulty score + specific recommendations.\\n\\n# What My Project Does\\n\\ncaniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:\\n\\n* A difficulty score (0–10)\\n* Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)\\n* What tools you’ll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)\\n* Whether using a scraping API might be better\\n\\nThis helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.\\n\\n# Target Audience\\n\\n* Web scrapers, data engineers, and researchers who deal with protected or dynamic websites\\n* Developers who want to test bot-detection systems or analyze site defenses\\n* Hobbyists learning about anti-bot tech and detection methods\\n\\nIt’s not a bypassing or cracking tool — it’s for diagnostics and awareness.\\n\\n# Comparison\\n\\nUnlike tools like WAFW00F or WhatWaf, which only detect web application firewalls,  \\ncaniscrape runs multi-layered tests:\\n\\n* Simulates browser and bot requests (via Playwright)\\n* Detects rate limits, JavaScript challenges, and honeypot traps\\n* Scores site difficulty based on detection layers\\n* Suggests scraping strategies or alternative services\\n\\nSo it’s more of a pre-scrape analysis toolkit, not just a WAF detector.\\n\\n# Installation\\n\\n    pip install caniscrape\\n\\nQuick setup (required):\\n\\n    playwright install chromium  # Download browser\\n    pipx install wafw00f         # WAF detection\\n\\n# Example Usage\\n\\n    caniscrape https://example.com\\n\\nOutput includes:\\n\\n* Difficulty score (0–10)\\n* Active protections\\n* Recommended tools/approach\\n\\n# ADVICE:\\n\\nResults can vary between runs because bot protections adapt dynamically.  \\nSome heavy-protection sites (like Amazon) may produce these varied results. Of course, this will improve over time, but running the command multiple times can mitigate this.\\n\\n# GitHub\\n\\n[https://github.com/ZA1815/caniscrape](https://github.com/ZA1815/caniscrape)\",\n",

It&amp;#39;ll take about 1-3 days but ill make it a lot better for the V1.0.0 release.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;CLI still available on GitHub for those who prefer it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;\\nI made a Python package called &lt;strong&gt;caniscrape&lt;/strong&gt; that analyzes any website&amp;#39;s anti-bot protections before you start scraping.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It tells you what you&amp;#39;re up against (Cloudflare, rate limits, JavaScript rendering, CAPTCHAs, TLS fingerprinting, honeypots) and gives you a difficulty score + specific recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;What My Project Does&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;caniscrape checks a website for common anti-bot mechanisms and reports:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;A difficulty score (0–10)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Which protections are active (e.g., Cloudflare, Akamai, hCaptcha, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;What tools you’ll likely need (headless browsers, proxies, CAPTCHA solvers, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Whether using a scraping API might be better&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This helps you decide the right scraping approach before you waste time building a bot that keeps getting blocked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Web scrapers, data engineers, and researchers who deal with protected or dynamic websites&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Developers who want to test bot-detection systems or analyze site defenses&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Hobbyists learning about anti-bot tech and detection methods&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It’s not a bypassing or cracking tool — it’s for diagnostics and awareness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Comparison&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike tools like WAFW00F or WhatWaf, which only detect web application firewalls,&lt;br/&gt;\\ncaniscrape runs multi-layered tests:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Simulates browser and bot requests (via Playwright)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Detects rate limits, JavaScript challenges, and honeypot traps&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Scores site difficulty based on detection layers&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Suggests scraping strategies or alternative services&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;So it’s more of a pre-scrape analysis toolkit, not just a WAF detector.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;pip install caniscrape\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Quick setup (required):&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;playwright install chromium  # Download browser\\npipx install wafw00f         # WAF detection\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Example Usage&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;caniscrape https://example.com\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Output includes:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Difficulty score (0–10)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Active protections&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Recommended tools/approach&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;ADVICE:&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Results can vary between runs because bot protections adapt dynamically.&lt;br/&gt;\\nSome heavy-protection sites (like Amazon) may produce these varied results.

Currently, a module is eagerly loaded at the point of the import statement. Lazy imports defer the loading and execution of a module until the first time the imported name is used.\\n\\nBy allowing developers to mark individual imports as lazy with explicit syntax, Python programs can reduce startup time, memory usage, and unnecessary work. This is particularly beneficial for command-line tools, test suites, and applications with large dependency graphs.\\n\\nThe proposal preserves full backwards compatibility: normal import statements remain unchanged, and lazy imports are enabled only where explicitly requested.',\n",

Currently, a module is eagerly loaded at the point of the import statement. Lazy imports defer the loading and execution of a module until the first time the imported name is used.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;By allowing developers to mark individual imports as lazy with explicit syntax, Python programs can reduce startup time, memory usage, and unnecessary work. This is particularly beneficial for command-line tools, test suites, and applications with large dependency graphs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The proposal preserves full backwards compatibility: normal import statements remain unchanged, and lazy imports are enabled only where explicitly requested.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.\\n\\nWhile it introduces everything that is relevant, it won\\'t hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.\\n\\nIf you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.\\n\\nAlthough the programming language isn\\'t exactly Python, it\\'s similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it.

The beginning of the game is designed to teach you all the basic programming concepts you will need by introducing them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While it introduces everything that is relevant, it won&amp;#39;t hold your hand when it comes to solving the various tasks in the game. You will have to figure those out for yourself, and that can be very challenging if you have never programmed before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you are an experienced programmer, you should be able to get through the early game very quickly and move on to the more complex tasks of the later game, which should still provide interesting challenges.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Although the programming language isn&amp;#39;t exactly Python, it&amp;#39;s similar enough that Python IntelliSense works well with it. All code is stored in .py files and can optionally be edited using external code editors like VS Code. When the &amp;quot;File Watcher&amp;quot; setting is enabled, the game automatically detects external changes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;You can find it here:\\xa0&lt;a href=\"https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160?utm_source=RD\"&gt;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060160/The_Farmer_Was_Replaced/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

It’s perfect for debugging, testing control flow, or adding a bit of fun to your scripts. The best part? You don’t even have to install it. Python natively supports Potato, thanks to its strict variable naming rules.\\n\\nJust type potato into your source code and watch the magic happen! Your script will immediately halt with a NameError, leaving your colleagues (or future self) wondering why there\\'s a potato in your code.\\n\\n# Why Potato?\\n\\n* **Zero Dependencies**: Potato requires absolutely no installations or updates.\\n* **Lightweight**: Takes up 0 bytes of storage.\\n* **Instant Debugging**: Clearly marks the exact point in your code where Potato strikes.\\n* **Fun for Everyone**: Confuse your friends, co-workers, and even your future self with a well-placed `potato`!\\n\\n# Installation\\n\\nThere is no installation. Python comes with Potato pre-installed. Simply open your favorite Python script and start typing `potato`.\\n\\n# Usage\\n\\n# Example 1: Halting a Script\\n\\n    print(\"Hello, world!\")\\n    potato\\n    print(\"This will never run.\")\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\n    Hello, world!\\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\\n      File \"example.py\", line 2, in &lt;module&gt;\\n        potato\\n    NameError: name \\'potato\\' is not defined\\n\\n# Example 2: Asserting Dominance in the Codebase\\n\\n    if user_input == \"42\":\\n        print(\"You cracked the ultimate answer!\")\\n    else:\\n        potato\\n\\n**Output:**\\n\\n    Traceback (most recent call last):\\n      File \"example.py\", line 4, in &lt;module&gt;\\n        potato\\n    NameError: name \\'potato\\' is not defined\\n\\n# Example 3: Leaving Easter Eggs\\n\\n    # TODO: Replace potato with actual logic later\\n    potato\\n\\n# Disclaimer\\n\\nPotato is not responsible for lost productivity, broken pipelines, or puzzled colleagues. Use responsibly (or irresponsibly, it’s up to you).\\n\\n# Contribute\\n\\nHave ideas to make Potato even better? Sorry, but it’s already perfect.\\n\\n# License\\n\\nPotato is released under the \"Completely Made Up\" license. Go ahead, use it however you like. Just don’t blame us when your boss asks why your code is full of potatoes.\\n\\n# Repository\\n\\nFind the source code and more on GitHub: [Potato Repository](https://github.com/andrewruba/potato)',\n",

It\\'s designed to be simple to use while handling a wide range of document formats.\\n\\n```python\\nfrom kreuzberg import extract_bytes, extract_file\\n\\n# Extract text from a PDF file\\nasync def extract_pdf():\\n    result = await extract_file(\"document.pdf\")\\n    print(f\"Extracted text: {result.content}\")\\n    print(f\"Output mime type: {result.mime_type}\")\\n\\n# Extract text from an image\\nasync def extract_image():\\n    result = await extract_file(\"scan.png\")\\n    print(f\"Extracted text: {result.content}\")\\n\\n# Or extract from a byte string\\n\\n# Extract text from PDF bytes\\nasync def process_uploaded_pdf(pdf_content: bytes):\\n    result = await extract_bytes(pdf_content, mime_type=\"application/pdf\")\\n    return result.content\\n\\n\\n# Extract text from image bytes\\nasync def process_uploaded_image(image_content: bytes):\\n    result = await extract_bytes(image_content, mime_type=\"image/jpeg\")\\n    return result.content\\n```\\n\\n## Comparison:\\nUnlike commercial solutions requiring API calls and usage limits, Kreuzberg runs entirely locally. \\n\\nCompared to other open-source alternatives, it offers a simpler API while still supporting a comprehensive range of formats, including:\\n\\n- PDFs (searchable and scanned)\\n- Images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.)\\n- Office documents (DOCX, ODT, RTF)\\n- Plain text and markup formats\\n\\nCheck out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg) for more details and examples.

It&amp;#39;s designed to be simple to use while handling a wide range of document formats.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;```python\\nfrom kreuzberg import extract_bytes, extract_file&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Extract text from a PDF file&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;async def extract_pdf():\\n    result = await extract_file(&amp;quot;document.pdf&amp;quot;)\\n    print(f&amp;quot;Extracted text: {result.content}&amp;quot;)\\n    print(f&amp;quot;Output mime type: {result.mime_type}&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Extract text from an image&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;async def extract_image():\\n    result = await extract_file(&amp;quot;scan.png&amp;quot;)\\n    print(f&amp;quot;Extracted text: {result.content}&amp;quot;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Or extract from a byte string&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Extract text from PDF bytes&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;async def process_uploaded_pdf(pdf_content: bytes):\\n    result = await extract_bytes(pdf_content, mime_type=&amp;quot;application/pdf&amp;quot;)\\n    return result.content&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Extract text from image bytes&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;async def process_uploaded_image(image_content: bytes):\\n    result = await extract_bytes(image_content, mime_type=&amp;quot;image/jpeg&amp;quot;)\\n    return result.content\\n```&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;Comparison:&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Unlike commercial solutions requiring API calls and usage limits, Kreuzberg runs entirely locally. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Compared to other open-source alternatives, it offers a simpler API while still supporting a comprehensive range of formats, including:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;PDFs (searchable and scanned)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Images (JPEG, PNG, TIFF, etc.)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Office documents (DOCX, ODT, RTF)&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;Plain text and markup formats&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Goldziher/kreuzberg\"&gt;GitHub repository&lt;/a&gt; for more details and examples. If you find this useful, a ⭐ would be greatly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The library is MIT-licensed and open to contributions. Let me know if you have any questions or feedback!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Trying to solve the problem myself often helps me a lot when I&amp;#39;m trying to grok how something works.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I had a lot of fun doing it and felt it might benefit others, so I ended up writing a blog post.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Anyway, here it is.

Sometimes the universe just comes together in such a way that makes you wonder if the simulation is winking back at you...\\n\\nBut now that I've grabbed your attention, allow me tell you a bit about my project.\\n\\n# What My Project Does\\n\\n[ridgeplot](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot?tab=readme-ov-file) is a Python package that provides a simple interface for plotting beautiful and interactive ridgeline plots within the extensive Plotly ecosystem.\\n\\nUnfortunately, I can't share any screenshots here, but feel free to take a look at our [**getting started guide**](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html) for some examples of what you can do with it.\\n\\n# Target Audience\\n\\nAnyone that needs to plot a ridgeline graph can use this library. That said, I expect it to be mainly used by people in the data science, data analytics, machine learning, and adjacent spaces.\\n\\n# Comparison\\n\\nIf all you need is a simple ridgeline plot with Plotly without any bells and whistles, take a look at [this example](https://plotly.com/python/violin/#ridgeline-plot) in their official docs. However, if you need more control over how the plot looks like, like plotting multiple traces per row, using different [coloring options](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/getting_started.html#coloring-options), or mixing [KDEs and histograms](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot/issues/194#issuecomment-2500864292), then I think my library would be a better choice for you...\\n\\nOther alternatives include:\\n\\n* [matplotlib - example blogpost](https://matplotlib.org/matplotblog/posts/create-ridgeplots-in-matplotlib/)\\n* [joypy - Ridgeplot library using a matplotlib backend](https://github.com/sbebo/joypy)\\n* [seaborn - also using a matplotlib backend](https://seaborn.pydata.org/examples/kde_ridgeplot)\\n* [bokeh - using yet a different graphing backend](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/examples/topics/categorical/ridgeplot.html)\\n\\nI [included](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/alternatives.html) these alternatives in the project's documentation. Feel free to contribute more!\\n\\n# Links\\n\\n* Repository: [https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot](https://github.com/tpvasconcelos/ridgeplot)\\n* Docs: [https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/](https://ridgeplot.readthedocs.io/)\",\n",

This is a [Wordle solver](https://github.com/mildbyte/uv-wordle-solver/) that generates a few thousand Python packages that encode a Wordle as a constraint satisfaction problem and then uses uv's dependency resolver to generate a lockfile, thus coming up with a potential solution. \\n\\nThe user tries it, gets a response from the Wordle website, the solver incorporates it into the package constraints and returns another potential solution and so on until the Wordle is solved or it discovers it doesn't know the word.\\n\\nBlog post on how it works [here](https://mildbyte.xyz/blog/solving-wordle-with-uv-dependency-resolver/)\\n\\n**Target audience**\\n\\nThis isn't really for production Wordle-solving use, although it did manage to solve today's Wordle, so perhaps it can become your daily driver.\\n\\n**Comparison**\\n\\nThere are lots of other Wordle solvers, but to my knowledge, this is the first Wordle solver on the market that uses a package manager's dependency resolver.\",\n",

It’s inspired by frameworks like PyTorch but designed for deeper understanding and experimentation. It supports core ML features like automatic differentiation, tensor operations, and computation graph building while being lightweight and modular (under 5k LOC).\\n\\n\\n\\n**Target Audience**\\n\\nMagnetron is intended for developers and researchers who want a transparent, low-level alternative to existing ML frameworks. It’s great for learning how ML frameworks work internally, experimenting with novel algorithms, or building custom features (feel free to hack).\\n\\n**Comparison**\\n\\nMagnetron differs from PyTorch and TensorFlow in several ways:\\n\\n• It’s entirely designed and implemented by me, with minimal external dependencies.\\n\\n• It offers a more modular and compact API tailored for both ease of use and low-level access.\\n\\n• The focus is on understanding and innovation rather than polished production features.\\n\\nMagnetron already supports CPU computation, automatic differentiation, and custom memory allocators. I’m currently implementing the CUDA backend, with plans to make it pip-installable soon.\\n\\n\\n\\nCheck it out here: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/MarioSieg/magnetron), [X Post](https://x.com/_mario_neo_/status/1875237757984907464)\\n\\n**Closing Note**\\n\\nInspired by Feynman’s philosophy, “What I cannot create, I do not understand,” Magnetron is my way of understanding machine learning frameworks deeply.

I've been working on a tool called [Deply](https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply), and I'd love to get your feedback and thoughts on it.\\n\\n# What My Project Does\\n\\n**Deply** is a standalone Python tool designed to enforce architectural patterns and dependencies in large Python projects. Deply analyzes your code structure and dependencies to ensure that architectural rules are followed. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable, and modular codebases.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n\\n* **Layer-Based Analysis**: Define custom layers (e.g., models, views, services) and restrict their dependencies.\\n* **Dynamic Configuration**: Easily configure collectors for each layer using file patterns and class inheritance.\\n* **CI Integration**: Integrate Deply into your Continuous Integration pipeline to automatically detect and prevent architecture violations before they reach production.\\n\\n# Target Audience\\n\\n* **Who It's For**: Developers and teams working on medium to large Python projects who want to maintain a clean architecture.\\n* **Intended Use**: Ideal for production environments where enforcing module boundaries is critical, as well as educational purposes to teach best practices.\\n\\n# Use Cases\\n\\n* **Continuous Integration**: Add Deply to your CI/CD pipeline to catch architectural violations early in the development process.\\n* **Refactoring**: Use Deply to understand existing dependencies in your codebase, making large-scale refactoring safer and more manageable.\\n* **Code Reviews**: Assist in code reviews by automatically checking if new changes adhere to architectural rules.\\n\\n# Comparison\\n\\nWhile there are existing tools like [pydeps](https://github.com/thebjorn/pydeps) that visualize dependencies, Deply focuses on:\\n\\n* **Enforcement Over Visualization**: Not just displaying dependencies but actively enforcing architectural rules by detecting violations.\\n* **Customization**: Offers dynamic configuration with various collectors to suit different project structures.\\n\\n# Links\\n\\n* **GitHub**: [https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply](https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply)\\n* **PyPI**: [https://pypi.org/project/deply/](https://pypi.org/project/deply/)\\n\\nI'm eager to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms. Deply is currently at version 0.1.5, so it's not entirely stable yet, but I'm actively working on it. I'm open to pull requests and looking forward to making Deply a useful tool for the Python community.\\n\\nThank you for your time!\",\n",

I&amp;#39;m a Python/PHP developer originally from Ukraine, now living in Wrocław, Poland. I&amp;#39;ve been working on a tool called &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply\"&gt;Deply&lt;/a&gt;, and I&amp;#39;d love to get your feedback and thoughts on it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;What My Project Does&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deply&lt;/strong&gt; is a standalone Python tool designed to enforce architectural patterns and dependencies in large Python projects. Deply analyzes your code structure and dependencies to ensure that architectural rules are followed. This promotes cleaner, more maintainable, and modular codebases.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Key Features:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Layer-Based Analysis&lt;/strong&gt;: Define custom layers (e.g., models, views, services) and restrict their dependencies.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dynamic Configuration&lt;/strong&gt;: Easily configure collectors for each layer using file patterns and class inheritance.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CI Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Integrate Deply into your Continuous Integration pipeline to automatically detect and prevent architecture violations before they reach production.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Target Audience&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who It&amp;#39;s For&lt;/strong&gt;: Developers and teams working on medium to large Python projects who want to maintain a clean architecture.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intended Use&lt;/strong&gt;: Ideal for production environments where enforcing module boundaries is critical, as well as educational purposes to teach best practices.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Use Cases&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Continuous Integration&lt;/strong&gt;: Add Deply to your CI/CD pipeline to catch architectural violations early in the development process.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactoring&lt;/strong&gt;: Use Deply to understand existing dependencies in your codebase, making large-scale refactoring safer and more manageable.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Code Reviews&lt;/strong&gt;: Assist in code reviews by automatically checking if new changes adhere to architectural rules.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Comparison&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While there are existing tools like &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/thebjorn/pydeps\"&gt;pydeps&lt;/a&gt; that visualize dependencies, Deply focuses on:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enforcement Over Visualization&lt;/strong&gt;: Not just displaying dependencies but actively enforcing architectural rules by detecting violations.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Customization&lt;/strong&gt;: Offers dynamic configuration with various collectors to suit different project structures.&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h1&gt;Links&lt;/h1&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ul&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply\"&gt;https://github.com/Vashkatsi/deply&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PyPI&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=\"https://pypi.org/project/deply/\"&gt;https://pypi.org/project/deply/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ul&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m eager to hear your thoughts, suggestions, or criticisms. Deply is currently at version 0.1.5, so it&amp;#39;s not entirely stable yet, but I&amp;#39;m actively working on it. I&amp;#39;m open to pull requests and looking forward to making Deply a useful tool for the Python community.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your time!&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

After digging into it, I discovered that deepcopy can actually be slower than even serializing and deserializing with pickle or json in many cases!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wrote up my findings on why this happens and some practical alternatives that can give you significant performance improvements: &lt;a href=\"https://www.codeflash.ai/post/why-pythons-deepcopy-can-be-so-slow-and-how-to-avoid-it\"&gt;https://www.codeflash.ai/post/why-pythons-deepcopy-can-be-so-slow-and-how-to-avoid-it&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;**TL;DR:** deepcopy&amp;#39;s recursive approach and safety checks create memory overhead that often isn&amp;#39;t worth it. The post covers when to use alternatives like shallow copy + manual handling, pickle round-trips, or restructuring your code to avoid copying altogether.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone else run into this?
